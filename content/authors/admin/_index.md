I am a Lecturer in Conservation Biology at the [The University of South Wales](https://www.southwales.ac.uk/) and the the Deputy Course Leader for BSc Natural History. My work is broadly focussed on conducting research that increases our understanding of species ecologies and informs conservation and management processes and policy. I am a member of USW's [Wildlife Ecology Research group](https://science.research.southwales.ac.uk/about/wildlife-ecology-research/).   

I'm always open to new collaborations and speaking to prospective students. If there's anything you'd like to discuss, please [get in touch](#contact).

I am the Editor of [Birds in Wales](https://birdsin.wales/what-we-do/our-journals/), Associate Editor of [*Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation*](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20563485), and creator and organiser of the twitter-based science communication project, [@Biotweeps](https://twitter.com/biotweeps).
