As a tutor I focus on flexible delivery, aiming to provide my students with skills, knowledge and confidence critical to their academic and personal development. I take an inclusive approach, developing strong relationships and encouraging discussion. I work to support my students in all aspects while respecting their individuality and independence.

GE1S008 - Observational Fieldwork  
Field-focussed, this module teaches fundamental ecological skills, including observational, surveying and recording techniques, species identification and behavioural observations.   


GE2S008 - Biodiversity and Biogeography   
Explores fundamental ideas in biogeography, including the global distribution or organisms in the past and present, and their relationships with physical environments.


GE2S017 - Research Methods in Natural History    
Supports the development of subject-specific skills through the use of meaningful examples in experimental tasks, underpinned with theoretical content.


GE3S009 - Mediterranean Field Expedition   
Field-focussed and centred on instrumental measurement, fieldwork surveys and analysis of material and data collected from areas within the Mediterranean biome.  


GE3S010 - Wildlife Population Ecology (from 2020/21)
Explores population and community ecology from fundamental principles to theoretical models, with a focus on practical applications.


GE3D002 - Natural History Research Project  (from 2020/21) 
Organising the allocation of research projects for third-year students and associated assessments.   


ES4S011 - European Field Expedition
